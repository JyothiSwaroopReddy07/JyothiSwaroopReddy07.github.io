      <description>&amp;ldquo;Darwin as an Embryo&amp;rdquo;. In this case, Neoteny really does recapitulates Phylogeny COURTESY: Stable Diffusion.
For this year&amp;rsquo;s delayed Darwin Day post, I will present some of the latest work on ancient embryos which we have been discussing in the DevoWorm group meetings. While this is by no means a complete review, we will discuss the earliest fossil evidence for eggs, embryos, and nervous systems (in animals, not plants), in addition to the conditions that lead to their emergence.</description>

      <description>The Learning on Graphs (LoG) conference took place from December 9-12 and featured a broad diversity of research on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs [1] encompass a relatively new area of machine learning research which have a number of interesting connections to applied math and network science. The daily sessions (keynote talks and oral presentations), in addition to the seven workshop sessions, are available from the conference YouTube channel.
GNNs are a way to take data that yield graphical relationships in the real world and analyze then using the power of neural networks.</description>

      <description>Work Done This Week (July 12th to July 19th)  Swapped out the model for the Cell membrane segmentation with the upgraded model in DevoLearn&amp;rsquo;s repository, ran tests locally before pushing because Travis has been discontinued. (Link to commit)    Renamed the embryo_segmentor package to cell_membrane_segmentor. The reason for this renaming is to avoid naming conflicts when new segmentation models are added. (Link to commit)
 Old syntax - from devolearn import embryo_segmentor New syntax - from devolearn import cell_membrane_segmentor    Integrated the new nucleus segmentation model into the library (Link to commit)</description>

      <description>Work Done This Week (July 5th to July 12th)  Refactored the training loop for the nucleus segentation model, this enabled faster prototyping and experimentation. Integrated Optuna for automated hyperparameter optimization. Ran 200 optuna trials to find training hyperparams. Optuna samples hyperparams from a given range, which in this case was -  Learning rate: 0.5e-3 to 20e-3 Batch Size: 8 to 64   Each trial trained the model on 10% of available data for 3 epochs, and returned the resulting IOU score.</description>

      <description>Most of my time this week was spent on building the training pipeline for the proposed cell nucleus segmentation model in C. elegans embryos.
Work Done This Week (June 28th to July 4th)   Back in week-1, I had worked on preprocessing data from the cell-tracking-challenge dataset. The dataset was extracted from .tif files and saved as pairs of .png files.
  To prevent anu CPU bottlenecks while training, I used PIL to resize all the training images to 1x256x256 beforehand.</description>

      <description>Work Done This Week (June 21st to June 27th)   Converted the upgraded segmentation model into ONNX format.
  Ran inference on the ONNX model (colab and local environment) to make sure it works. Then used Gradio to build a GUI.
  The next step was to host this online. Gradio has their own hosting service, but that costs $7/month. Looked into ways of hosting apps online for free, decided to go with Heroku.</description>

      <description>The goal for this week was to upgrade the DevoLearn cell membrane segmentation model. Feel free to check out the code - Link
Work Done This Week (June 14th to June 20th) 1. Fixed the Preprocessing Pipeline:  Fixed a strange issue that led to an offset in the image filenames. Used PNG format to store the images instead of JPG (which was being used). The JPG format led to lossy edges in segmentation maps, which was being tackled using OpenCV based operations, but that led to larger gaps between the segmentation maps of individual cells.</description>

Our virtual discussion group (DevoWormML) has been exploring a number of topics related to the use of pre-trained models in machine learning (specifically deep learning). Pre-trained models such as GPT-2 [1], pix2pix [2], and OpenPose [3] are used for analyzing many specialized types of data (linguistics, image to image translation, and human body features, respectively) and have a number of potential uses for the analysis of biological data in particular.</description>

      <description>Worm images courtesy of the OpenWorm browser (Drs. Christian Grove and Padraig Gleeson) Regular readers of this blog might recall that the OpenWorm Foundation spearheaded a workshop (From Connectome to Behavior) at the Royal Society (London) in January 2018. This workshop generated a lot of social media content and internal (to OpenWorm Slack) discussion of the presented topics.
Since then, the participants have been hard at work putting together a special issue (now live in Royal Society B) that presents in more detail what was discussed at the meeting.</description>

      <description>The DevoWorm group has two new students that will be working over this summer on topics in computational embryogenesis. To begin their projects, I have asked each student to prepare a short presentation based on their original proposal, which serves as a variant of the traditional &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; program. We will then compare this talk with one they will give at the end of the summer to evaluate their learning and accomplishment trajectory.</description>

      <description>UCLA and Los Angeles. COURTESY: UCLA Department of Physiology. I just returned from the International C. elegans Meeting in Los Angeles (being hosted on the UCLA campus). There are posters, talks, workshops, and much fun to be had. I will give a more detailed discussion of some of the sessions in a future post.
Some people (not me) took turns wearing the &#34;worm suit&#34;. COURTESY: #worm15 Twitter feed. There were several days of talks and posters, plus the famous C.</description>

      <description>In the past year, I have been starting to use the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (roundworm) as a model organism. Not only have I helped to establish the DevoWorm project, I am also starting to engage with C. elegans in a wet-lab setting. As a consequence, I am learning about multiple facets of C. elegans biology. C. elegans is a well-established model organism, having well-characterized neural and developmental systems. The nervous system contains just 302 cells, with a full accounting of the connectome (synaptic connections) [1].</description>

      <description>This Friday (9/12) at 9am PDT, I will be presenting a talk to the OpenWorm consortium Journal Club on the DevoWorm project. For those of you who are unfamiliar, DevoWorm is a collaborative attempt to simulate and theoretically re-interpret C. elegans development.
Cover slide with a list of the DevoWorm collaborators, circa September 2014. The structure of the talk will loosely follow the white paper, with some additional theoretical and translational information.</description>

      <description>Over the past few months, myself and several colleagues (Stephen Larson, Dick Gordon, Steve McGrew, Mark Watts, and possibly Jack Tuszynski) have begun to hash out the details of a new project called DevoWorm. The project white paper, which lays out our goals and the associated technical details, can be found here. This is an extension of the existing OpenWorm project [1], which is an attempt to digitally emulate a relatively simple organism (C.</description>
